# GrocerySaver
A fun little collaborative project done in ten weeks. 
## Goals
1. Develop an application of our choosing from scratch and present a workable demo.
2. Participate in a compressed, simulated version of the software development life cycle, including research and documentation.
## Results
GrocerySaver is an Android application for tracking food expiration dates. For a food item that you purchase, enter in its expiration date,
and GrocerySaver will notify you when it is about to expire. You can also set periodic reminders and digests on the contents of your
refrigerator and pantry. If you're unsure about a product's expiration date, GrocerySaver can provide some recommended times for you.
